        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            Right now, my primary hobby is playing board games. I grew up playing video games and only within the last three years or so have I discovered board games other than Monopoly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every Saturday or Sunday, my wife and I gather up our three kids and head over to our friends' house and play board games together. We have been doing this for about two year now and our respective collection of games have exploded. Some of our favorites include Pandemic Legacy Seasons 1 and 2, Wingspan, and Azul, but honestly, we have too many to list.

          <p>
            While the adults are enthralled in analog gaming, our boys, ages 14 and 9, play with our friends' boys in the digital realm of Fortnite. Lastly our 4 year old daughter lets in with her mom and dad, watching us play or she watches her favorite show on Netflix, My Little Pony.
